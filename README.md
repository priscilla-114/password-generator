## Personal Comments & Contributions
These past weeks have been tough at work. I was at a complete loss as to where to start on this project and definitely need more time to allow the basics of Javascript to sink in. I didn't want to not turn in anything in so I followed along with a completed project I came across as I searched for tutorials. I hope to come back to this and start from scratch with my own code.
